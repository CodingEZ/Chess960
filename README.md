# Chess960

Chess960 is a version of chess with a randomized back row of pieces, with the standard set of pawns located in front. The only libraries required are built-in. To run the program, download the files and run the Play.java file. Have fun!

This project has largely been a learning experience in writing in Java, as this is my first program in the language. Overall, it was a rewarding experience.
